# RandomNumberBlock
This is a first-prize-winner project of ShenZhen Experimental Shchool Maker Fair 2017. 
The previous name of the project is "RandomNumberBox", which also refers to an old configuration design. 
The 3D-printed block is used in two ways, one of which is that you can gain a random number by pushing the button. 
The other way enables you to get a large number of random numbers by using the serial console. 
By connecting the box to a PC, generation configurations can also be chenged via the serial console. 
The random numbers are generated based on the data returned by a sound sensor, which makes the numbers more random. 
Coding by HaoRan "Hurry" Peng, generation algorithm by ZheWei Zhang.
